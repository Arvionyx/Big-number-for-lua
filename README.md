# Big-number-for-lua
A script able to read numbers as large as you want and calculate with a precision of up to 60 digits.
This script is not yet fully finished, it is currently being developed, I am still working on modifying the script so that it will be able to calculate extremely large numbers with a maximun time of 0.01 seconds (current is 0.03) for any form of calculation including pentation. If you find any issues or bug with the code you could just simply tell me and I will fix is as soon as i can. The formatting the script is able to read is with G, F and E notations with G being the largest magnitude, the notation with the largest magnitude must be placed in front of the notations with lower magnitudes (e.g 3G7Fee9).
